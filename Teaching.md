I have taught in a variety of environments and levels, and I have participated in several courses for teaching development. This experience has given me important teaching accomplishments and goals. Besides teaching courses, I have supervised more than 10 undergraduate students in their graduation project.  One of the main accomplishments is the promotion of research experience for undergraduate students. During my courses, I promote the long-term learning of the general principles and the development of the skills through motivation, interaction, and guidance.  My teaching experience include the following course:
